SCENE forest_wilderness
TITLE The Wilderness
BGIMG bg_forest_wilderness.png
PROSE
| The forest stretches on for miles in every direction. The trees are
| ancient, and the forest floor is thick with brush and fallen branches.
| It would be easy to get lost here, so you consider your options before
| setting out. Based on your map and knowledge of the area, you decide to...
OPTION forest_cave Travel to the Crystal Cavern.
OPTION forest_wandering Wander aimlessly, hoping to stumble across something.

SCENE forest_wandering
TITLE The Wilderness
BGIMG bg_forest_wandering.png
PROSE
| This forest is vast, and progress is slow. You'll never be able
| to find anything new just by searching on foot. You'll need to rely on
| maps or directions of some kind to find your way. Realizing this, you...
OPTION forest_wilderness Stop and choose a destination.

SCENE forest_cave
TITLE Forest Cave
BGIMG bg_cave_in_a_forest.png
PROSE
| Deep in the forest there is a cave hidden amidst the trees. The area is
| calm and peaceful. Branches sway in the breeze, and you are surrounded
| by the sounds of the forest.
OPTION forest_cave_observe Observe the cave from a distance.
OPTION crys_cave_entr Approach the cave entrance.
OPTION forest_wilderness Leave this place, returning to the wilderness.

SCENE forest_cave_observe
TITLE Observing the Cave
BGIMG bg_cave_in_a_forest.png
PROSE
| The cave is little more than a dark hole in a stone cliff face. It looks
| like a natural cavern; the surrounding stone is smooth and ancient, shaped
| by erosion. Observing for a short time, you see no signs of activity. It
| seems safe to approach, so you...
OPTION crys_cave_entr Approach the cave entrance.
OPTION forest_cave Stay here for now.

SCENE crys_cave_entr
TITLE Cave Entrance
BGIMG bg_tunnel_to_light.png
PROSE
| Just inside the cave mouth. Forest to the south, tunnel to the north.
| No sign of wildlife or other people. The tunnel ahead is dark, but there
| is a faint bluish light in the distance. You...
OPTION crys_cave_deep Travel deeper into the cave.
OPTION forest_cave Leave the cave, returning to the forest.

SCENE crys_cave_deep
TITLE The Crystal Cavern
BGIMG back_001.png
PROSE
| Deep in the cavern, the cold air smells of wet stone and a hint of
| ozone. The walls in this area are studded with softly glowing crystals
| of various colors and sizes.
OPTION crys_cave_bottom Go deeper along the main tunnel.
OPTION crys_cave_west Follow a side tunnel to the west.
OPTION crystal_pull Inspect the crystals more closely.
OPTION crys_cave_entr Return to the cave entrance.

SCENE crys_cave_west
TITLE Dark Hollow
PROSE
| There is a small chamber at the end of a short passage, west from the
| main tunnel. There are no crystals here, leaving the chamber in shadow.
| There doesn't seem to be anything of use here, so you...
OPTION crys_cave_west_search Search the chamber more carefully.
OPTION crys_cave_west_rest Rest here for a bit, concealed by the shadows.
OPTION crys_cave_deep Return to the main passage.

SCENE crys_cave_bottom
TITLE The Crystal Core
PROSE
| The main passage ends in a large chamber dominated by a huge glowing crystal.
| It hums with energy and getting closer may be dangerous, but the floor near it
| is scattered with loose glowing crystals. They would be quite valuable if you
| could retrieve them.
OPTION crys_cave_deep Leave this chamber, moving back toward the entrance.

SCENE crys_cave_west_rest
TITLE A Short Rest
PROSE
| This corner of the cavern is quiet and relatively dry. You rest for a time,
| regaining some of your strength. Eventually, you...
OPTION crys_cave_west Finish resting.

SCENE crys_cave_west_search
TITLE Searching the Dark Hollow
PROSE
| Groping around in the darkness, you can't find anything of note. There
| is a faint sense of energy as if some sort of magic is present, but
| you cannot find the source. You decide to...
OPTION crys_cave_west Abandon the search for now.

SCENE crystal_pull
TITLE Collecting Crystals
PROSE
| The crystals are stuck fast in the cave walls. It will not be easy to
| pull them loose. You...
OPTION crys_cave_deep Leave the crystals for now.

SCENE scifi_horror_door
TITLE The Horror Dimension
BGIMG bg_eerie_blue_door_r.png
PROSE
| This room is dark, with cold metallic walls and floor. The only exit
| is an open doorway lit by an eerie blue glow on the other side.
OPTION scifi_horror_corridor Explore further.
OPTION forest_wilderness Exit the Horror Dimension, returning to the forest.

SCENE scifi_horror_corridor
TITLE The Red Corridor
BGIMG bg_ominous_red_corridor.png
PROSE
| This corridor is lit only by a garish red light shining through an open
| door at the far end. The air is close and humid; condensation glistens
| on the cold metal walls. You can just barely hear the constant on-off
| screech of a warning klaxon in the distance.
OPTION scifi_horror_door Flee from this awful place.

SCENE forest_wilderness
OPTION scifi_horror_door Step through a portal to the Horror Dimension.
